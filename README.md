# Clustering Algorithms From Scratch
### In this project, I develop both K-Means and Spectral Clustering methods using only Numpy

#### Further in the investigation I test these two clustering methods on Elliptical and Sqaure datasets, as well as Iyer and Cho

With various manualy implemented hyperparamters such as:
- Normalizatation of Laplacian Matrix
- Random init of centroids
- Similarity Kernels (Gaussian and Cosine)
- Sigma for Gaussian Kernal
- Epsilon for Similarity threshold
